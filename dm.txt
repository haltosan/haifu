programs:
must be in haiku form (5-7-5 syllable lines)


haikus/stanzas:


lines:


words:
must be english
can not be split across lines
hyphenated words are one word
if literal, may be hyphenated across lines to keep structure
must not be vulgar


yin/yang:
basically binary
must be balanced
yin - even numbers
yang - odd numbers
fp is rounded away from 0 (1.2 is yin, -2.3 is yang)
when returned, use some int of the correct type (implementation specific)

elements:
earth, fire, water, wood, metal
creation
	earth -> metal
	metal -> water
	water -> wood
	wood  -> fire
	fire  -> earth
destruction
	earth -> water
	water -> fire
	fire  -> metal
	metal -> wood
	wood  -> earth
love
	earth -> fire
	fire  -> wood
	wood  -> water
	water -> metal
	metal -> earth
fear
	earth -> wood
	wood  -> metal
	metal -> fire
	fire  -> water
	water -> earth


celestial bureaucracy:
stack?
only placed on bottom
move up by moving upper item down
any item can be removed from any rung

on load, all words (minus comments and punctuation) are put in order into the Celestial Bureaucracy
	1st word is closest to Heaven, last word is on the bottom


celestial bureaucrat:
interprets bottom up
stops when it reaches Heaven (above highest word)
points at rungs, but doesn't occupy position
when it encounters a variable, the instructions for that variable are executed
	if undefined, continue

Delegate:
begins on bottom rung
moves at direction of the bureaucrat
can never be above bureaucrat (stops at bureaucrat level)


data:
numbers (int and fp) only
	can be interpreted differently in i/o, use unicode values
literals are single words
	one, none, century, two-hundred
max literal is limited by stanza
rand value is rand int evaluated whenever encountered by the bureaucrat/delegate
fp's are cast to int by the striving rules (yin/yang)
literals are earth quality
bureaucrat skips literals and continues to next rung


variables:
non-reserved, non-vulgar word may be used as a variable name
should be related to an element, defaults to earth
var maintains the quality of the element until changed by an operator
plural/singular are the same variable (tree/trees)
when placed in the bureaucracy, it is the variable and not just the value
	can be copied, each will point to the same variable
can contain instructions
<punctuation> <variable name> <definition>* <punctuation / variable name>


comments:
, <comment>* ,/<eof>
counts towards syllable count
can span stanzas/lines
not interpreted by b
